is a type of artificial intelligence that can **create new, original content** that has never existed before, rather than just analyzing or processing existing data.\\n\\nThink of it like an artificial \"artist\" or \"writer\" that has studied countless examples of a particular type of content (text, images, audio, code, etc.) and can then generate new pieces in a similar style or on a given topic, often in response to a simple prompt.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of what that means:\\n\\n1.  **\"Generative\" Aspect:**\\n    *   The core idea is to **generate** something new. Unlike traditional AI that might classify, predict, or recognize patterns in existing data (e.g., \"Is this a cat or a dog?\"), Generative AI *produces* outputs.\\n    *   These outputs are not just copies; they are novel creations that often exhibit a level of creativity or coherence that mimics human-made content.\\n\\n2.  **How it Works (Simplified):**\\n    *   **Training Data:** Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets of existing content (e.g., millions of images, billions of text documents, hours of audio).\\n    *   **Pattern Learning:** During training, the AI learns the underlying patterns, structures, styles, and relationships within that data. It essentially learns the \"rules\" of how text, images, or sound are composed.\\n    *   **Generation:** When given a prompt or input (e.g., \"write a poem about a flying cat,\" \"create an image of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars\"), the AI uses its learned knowledge to predict and assemble new content that aligns with the prompt and its training. It essentially \"imagines\" what that content should look like based on everything it has seen.\\n\\n3.  **Key Characteristics:**\\n    *   **Novelty:** It produces original content.\\n    *   **Realism/Plausibility:** The generated content often looks, sounds, or reads very realistic and coherent.\\n    *   **Versatility:** Can be applied to many different types of data.\\n    *   **Prompt-driven:** Users typically interact with it by providing specific instructions or descriptions (prompts).\\n\\n4.  **Common Types and Examples:**\\n    *   **Text Generation (Large Language Models - LLMs):**\\n        *   **Examples:** ChatGPT, Google Bard/Gemini, Llama, Claude.\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Writing articles, stories, poems, emails, code, answering questions, summarizing text, translating languages.\\n    *   **Image Generation:**\\n        *   **Examples:** DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Creating photorealistic images, artistic illustrations, concept art, modifying existing images, based on text descriptions.\\n    *   **Audio Generation:**\\n        *   **Examples:** Music composition tools, text-to-speech with expressive voices, sound effect generators.\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Composing music, generating lifelike voiceovers, creating ambient sounds.\\n    *   **Video Generation:**\\n        *   **Examples:** RunwayML Gen-1/Gen-2, Google Imagen Video.\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Creating short video clips from text or images, modifying existing videos.\\n    *   **Code Generation:**\\n        *   **Examples:** GitHub Copilot.\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Suggesting code, completing functions, debugging, translating code between languages.\\n    *   **3D Model Generation:**\\n        *   **Capabilities:** Creating 3D objects and environments from text descriptions or 2D images.\\n\\n**Why is it a big deal?**\\n\\nGenerative AI is a game-changer because it automates and democratizes content creation, enabling individuals and businesses to produce high-quality, customized content much faster and at a lower cost than ever before.

During this training, they learn the underlying patterns, styles, relationships, and characteristics of that data.\n\n2.  **Creates New Content:** Once trained, the model can then use this learned knowledge to generate entirely new outputs based on a given prompt or input. It doesn't just copy-paste; it understands *how* the original data was constructed and can create something new that follows those same \"rules\" or aesthetics.\n\n3.  **Examples of What it Can Generate:**\n    *   **Text:** Writing articles, stories, poems, emails, code, summaries, answering questions in a conversational manner (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard).\n    *   **Images:** Creating realistic photos from text descriptions, generating art in various styles, designing product mockups, altering existing images (e.g., DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion).\n    *   **Audio:** Generating music, creating realistic voiceovers, producing sound effects.\n    *   **Video:** Creating short video clips from text, animating still images, changing video styles.\n    *   **Code:** Writing code snippets, debugging, explaining programming concepts.\n    *   **3D Models:** Generating models for games, architecture, or design.\n\n**Key Characteristics of Generative AI:**\n\n*   **Creativity (Simulated):** It can produce outputs that appear creative and original, often surprising human users.\n*   **Novelty:** The generated content is new and unique, not just a retrieval of existing information.\n*   **Coherence:** The outputs are often logically consistent and contextually relevant, especially after significant training.\n*   **Versatility:** It can be applied to various data types (text, image, audio, video) and tasks.\n*   **Prompt-Driven:** Users typically provide a \"prompt\" (a text description, an image, etc.) to guide the generation process.\n\n**How is it different from \"Traditional AI\"?**\n\n*   **Traditional (Discriminative) AI:** Focuses on *analysis* and *prediction*. It takes an input and classifies it, predicts a value, or identifies something (e.g., \"Is this email spam?\", \"What's the best route?\", \"Which product should I recommend?\"). It discriminates between different categories.\n*   **Generative AI:** Focuses on *creation*. It takes an input (often a prompt) and *generates* something new (e.g., \"Write an email,\" \"Draw a picture of a cat riding a skateboard,\" \"Compose a short jazz tune\").\n\nIn essence, Generative AI enables computers to be more than just powerful calculators or classifiers; it allows them to be **creators**, opening up new possibilities across almost every industry."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["system_prompt = 'You are an expert in Generative AI, whenevr user asks some queries respond in very concise and informative way'\n","system_prompt"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"JoJj_rs9ceT_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765200583997,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Zohra Jameel","userId":"14195063825000585172"}},"outputId":"98fea98b-b1f5-4bb8-b6d1-1d41f5794d9c"},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'You are an expert in Generative AI, whenevr user asks some queries respond in very concise and informative way'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":35}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name = 'models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite', system_instruction = system_prompt)\n","model"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"cYp0qzP1dCry","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765200620695,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":52,"user":{"displayName":"Zohra Jameel","userId":"14195063825000585172"}},"outputId":"d33d1de8-1228-4ef3-82db-e18d393eccdd"},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["genai.GenerativeModel(\n","    model_name='models/gemini-2.5-flash-lite',\n","    generation_config={},\n","    safety_settings={},\n","    tools=None,\n","    system_instruction='You are an expert in Generative AI, whenevr user asks some queries respond in very concise and informative way',\n","    cached_content=None\n",")"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":36}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["response = model.generate_content('What is Generative AI?')\n","Markdown(response.text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":64},"id":"LmbvDuFLdRbQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765200643721,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1389,"user":{"displayName":"Zohra Jameel","userId":"14195063825000585172"}},"outputId":"532cb634-e42f-40b9-dc78-c9abd52de610"},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>"],"text/markdown":"Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can **create new, original content**, such as text, images, music, or code, rather than just analyzing or acting on existing data."},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Loop -
